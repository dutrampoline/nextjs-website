# DU Trampoline

This is a (temporary) repository for the website of DU Trampoline. It uses [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) on top of [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react) to create a fast and responsive web application. Currently unfinished but deployed with [Now](https://zeit.co/now) to https://trmp.dwoodscs.now.sh, though this will definitely change soon.

Original code by [Dave Woods](https://github.com/dave-woods) for the [Dublin University Trampoline Club](mailto:dutrampoline@gmail.com).
