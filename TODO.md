## To do

- Update homepage to be more attractive (images etc.)
- Photos page | Pull in from Google Photos? Or just select some good ones and have to update them manually from time to time?
- Competitions page | Upcoming details and recent results
- Fix distance between nav and title e.g. on Committee page
- Make background colour a little darker to make whites stand out more?
- Make news posts and competitions into cards
- Use the new [dynamic routing](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/clean-urls-with-dynamic-routing/dynamic-routing) for news posts
- Update `package.json` with details of new repo and contributor
- Use new [backend API](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#api-routes) for backend stuff üòÅ
  - Maybe do the data loading using this?
  - This could be used to host forms, or generally allow users to input stuff (though input should be validated/sanititised)
- Figure out if it's possible to have some centralised CSS files, or else just put some variables in the head so certain values can be shared across components
- Make the components' code more consistent, and actually use the components directory rather than just putting components in page files (this will help with better code splitting!)
- Add club history somewhere
- Add fun things like a tariff calculator, or a section where you can watch videos displaying various different skills -- maybe add/embed the youtube page somewhere (maybe change "Photos" to "Media")
- Try to preload images on committee page, or use smaller size images to fake it
- Make the site a bit narrower on desktop? It might be fine as is, but could maybe look better with a slight margin on all content
- Section talking about our gear (hoodies, leos, trackies, etc.), and maybe trampolining as a general sport
