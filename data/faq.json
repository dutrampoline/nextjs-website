       "question": "How much does it cost?",
       "answer": "It's â‚¬4 to join, and training is free after that!"
    },
    {
        "question": "Do I need any experience?",
        "answer": "Nope, none at all. We have trained coaches who can work with you from the absolute basics."
     },
     {
        "question": "Where do you bounce?",
        "answer": "Our trampolines are in the Main Hall on floor 3 of the Trinity Sports Centre. Don't worry if you don't see them, they're stored away when we're not training."
     },
     {
        "question": "How much effort do I have to put in?",
        "answer": "You can bounce with us as often or as little as you like, and you can start at any point in the year. Of course, you'll progress further the more you train, but if you don't have time, that's totally fine."
     },
     {
        "question": "Can my friends come and bounce too?",
        "answer": "As long as they're students or staff members of the university, they're welcome to join!"
     },
     {
        "question": "Can I do flips? I have a trampoline in my garden!",
        "answer": "Eventually! Our trampolines are a lot bouncier than a garden trampoline, so our coaches will assess your level before we let you do anything dangerous. Don't be put off if we don't let you do triple-twisting double somersaults straight away! We'll take the time to make sure you've got the technique down right."
     },
     {
        "question": "What do you actually do?",
        "answer": "Bounce! Trampolining is a discipline of gymnastics, so we focus on developing skills for competitive routines at levels ranging from Novice to Elite-Pro."
     },
     {
        "question": "What if I don't want to compete?",
        "answer": "That's fine too, we won't push you if you don't want to. Just come along and have some fun (we have plenty of social events too)!"
